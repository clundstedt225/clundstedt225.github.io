										<h3>Project Summary</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Slice & Dice was the final senior capstone project for NHTI. For this project, we had to agree on and bring a game from concept
										to playable demo by the end of the spring (or about 9 months). We ended up deciding on a 3D fighting game to keep the scope of 
										the project more manageable for the given deadline. To help set the game apart we wanted to also implement a slicing mechanic where
										you could cut your opponent into pieces once you beat them. This is where the theme of our game emerged from as well since our project
										needed to be academically friendly and thus we opted for a less violent and more cartoonish style. After creating a prototype level, my
										 role on this team was then to model, rig, and animate the characters for project. After characters were finished, I was able to liase with the programmers/designers on the team 
										to integrate them into the game engine.

										<h3>Development & Challenges</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										A lot of the challenge for this project came from the team work aspect and staying on the same page with everyone. To add to this we had to
										transition from in person to remote once the covid pandemic affected our usual routines. We worked in 2 week sprints to start the project and
										practiced daily stand up meetings as well. Once we went to a remote environment we were able to maintain our progress on the project through
										github as source controll for the project and the use of discord chat rooms. Additionally, I was able to create and maintain an excell spreadsheet 
										for the progress on all of our characters and animations to better keep track of everything. In hindsight our 6 playable character goal was a bit too ambitous and we 
										should have probobly stuck with less to save on time and quality.
